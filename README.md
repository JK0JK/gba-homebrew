# You're not supposed to be here
This is a repository of the smaller projects I've completed while learning GBA homebrew.

While in a way this is helpful for projects like Minigame Investigator, this is mostly for documenting my learning.

# Building
To compile these projects you will need
1. [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
